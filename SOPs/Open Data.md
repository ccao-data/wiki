The Cook County Assessor's Office is committed to transparency. In order to fulfill that commitment, the Data Department is tasked with creating and maintaining public data sets. This document outlines these data, their uses, and pertinent source code. 

The Cook County Assessor's Office publishes data on the [Cook County Open Data Portal](https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/browse?tags=cook+county+assessor). The [AssessR](https://ccao-data-science---modeling.gitlab.io/packages/assessr/articles/example-ratio-study.html) package leverages this open data in its documentation.

## Releasing Open Data

Releasing open data entails building reproducible data, documenting it, determining how and how often it should be updated, and recieving clearance from all necessary parties. These steps are outlined in further detail below.

### Building Data

Open data should, whenever possible, reflect data that is automatically updated (views or tables in Athena), well-maintained, or that doesn't depend on being updated often (political boundaries).  Datasets that are releasesed to the public ***must be scripted and the script must be version-controlled***. Data should not be built in a manner that is inconsistent with how it is used within the department as to avoid creating discrepancies between internal and public use of the department's data. Keep data as simple as possible - don't add columns that won't be useful for end-users and don't release redundant data.

Open data upload can also be automated using Socrata's SODA API and the [RSocrata package](https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata).

### Adding Data to the Portal

The data department releases open data through the Cook County Open Data Portal, a service mainted by Socrata.  For data that lives in the department's warehouse, the preferred method for upload is through a provisioned Athena or S3 Socrata Gateway.  When creating a new dataset there will be an opportunity to 'Connect to an External Data Source (Socrata Gateway)' where available data can be viewed. Make sure to add data to the portal using the department's rather than a personal account in order to properly establish ownership of the asset.

During the upload process set a schedule for updates (when applicable), add dataset metadata, and document, code/recode, and format columns.  Recoding or 'transforming' columns entails writing SoQL blurbs while formatting columns is interactive within the 'Review & Configure Data' view. Choose a schedule that ensures the data is current but that doesn't needlessly pull data from AWS and run up monthly operating expenses - Socrata only offers daily to monthly update schedules, so if the data changes less frequently than that it should likely be updated manually (shapefiles). Adhere to the departent's asset naming convention by prefixing the asset with 'Assessor' and tag it with `property tax` and `cook county assessor`.  Add documentation for the data to this wiki page.

It is highly recommended to create a 'Story' on Socrata or add to an existing one in order to describe and vignette the data for its intended audience.

### Clearance

Clearance must be recieved from the following parties before private assets on the open data portal can be made public:

- Chief Data Officer
- Executive Committee, FOIA, Comms (optionally, TPI)
- Bureau of Technology

BoT may have their own clearance requirements such as adding a 'Story' on Socrata or formatting common county-related columns in a particular way. Defer to their schemas.

## Currently Curated Data 

The Data Department creates and maintains the following open data sets.

### [Parcel Universe](https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/Property-Taxation/Assessor-Parcel-Universe/tx2p-k2g9)

| Timeframe    | Property Classes | Unique By | Row    | Updated |
| :---:        | :---:            | :---:     | :---:  | :---:   |
| 1999-Present | All              | PIN, Year | Parcel | Monthly |

**Notes**: Contains a cornucopia of locational and spatial data for all parcels in Cook County.

**Use cases:** Joining parcel-level data to this dataset allows analaysis and reporting across a number of different poltiical, tax, census, and other boundaries. Distances to a number of common ammenities can be used for spatial analysis.

**Code:** [default-vw_pin_universe.sql](https://gitlab.com/ccao-data-science---modeling/data-architecture/-/blob/master/aws-athena/views/default-vw_pin_universe.sql)

### [Single and Multi-Family Improvement Characteristics](https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/Property-Taxation/Assessor-Single-and-Multi-Family-Improvement-Chara/x54s-btds)

| Timeframe    | Property Classes | Unique By | Row                         | Updated   |
| :---:        | :---:            | :---:     | :---:                       | :---:     |
| 1999-Present | [Regression-class](https://gitlab.com/ccao-data-science---modeling/models/ccao_res_avm#data-used)         | PIN, Card, Year | Residential Improvement | Bi-Weekly |

**Notes**: Residential PINs with multiple improvements (living structures) will have one card for _each_ improvement.

**Use cases:** This data describes the location and physical characteristics of all single and multi-family improvements in the county. It can be used

- on its own to characterize the housing stock in a specific location
- joined to assessments for analysis of assessments across geographies and housing types
- joined to sales for the construction of hedonic home value estimates

**Code:** [default-vw_card_res_char.sql](https://gitlab.com/ccao-data-science---modeling/data-architecture/-/blob/master/aws-athena/views/default-vw_card_res_char.sql)

### [Residential Condominium Parcel Characteristics](https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/Property-Taxation/Assessor-Residential-Condominium-Parcel-Characteri/3r7i-mrz4)

| Timeframe    | Property Classes | Unique By | Row              | Updated  |
| :---:        | :---:            | :---:     | :---:            | :---:    |
| 1999-Present | 299, 399         | PIN, Year | Condominium Unit | Bi-Weekly |

**Notes:**

**Use cases:** This data describes the location and physical characteristics of all condominium units in the county. Condominium units are associated with substantially less characteristics data than single and multi-family improvements. It can be used

- on its own to characterize the housing stock in a specific location
- joined to assessments for analysis of assessments across geographies and housing types
- joined to sales for the construction of hedonic home value estimates

**Code:** [default-vw_pin_condo_char.sql](https://gitlab.com/ccao-data-science---modeling/data-architecture/-/blob/master/aws-athena/views/default-vw_pin_condo_char.sql)

### [Parcel Sales](https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/Property-Taxation/Assessor-Parcel-Sales/wvhk-k5uv)

| Timeframe    | Property Classes | Unique By        | Row         | Updated |
| :---:        | :---:            | :---:            | :---:       | :---:   |
| 1999-Present | All              | Sale Deed Number | Parcel Sale | Monthly |

**Notes:** Refreshed monthly, though data may only change roughly quarterly depending on how often new sales are added to iasWorld. 

**Use cases:** Alone, sales data can be used to characterize real estate markets. Sales paired with characteristics can be used to find comparable properties or as an input to an automated modeling application. Sales paired with assessments can be used to calculate sales ratio statistics. Outliers can be easily removed using filters constructed on class, township, and year.

### [Historic Parcel Values](https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/Property-Taxation/Assessor-Historic-Parcel-Values/uzyt-m557)

| Timeframe    | Property Classes | Unique By | Row    | Updated |
| :---:        | :---:            | :---:     | :---:  | :---:   |
| 1999-Present | All              | PIN, Year | Parcel | Monthly |

**Notes:** Refreshed monthly, data is updated as towns are mailed/certified by valuations and the Board of Review. 

**Use cases:** Alone, can characterize assessments in a given area. Can be combined with characteristic data to make more nuanced generalizations about assessments. Can be combined with sales data to conduct ratio studies.

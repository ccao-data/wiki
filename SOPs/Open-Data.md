The Cook County Assessor's Office is committed to transparency. To fulfill that commitment, the Data Department creates and maintains public assessment-related data sets. This document outlines these data, their uses, and pertinent source code. Data is published primarily on the [Cook County Open Data Portal](https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/browse?tags=cook+county+assessor) and through GitHub. The [AssessR](https://ccao-data.github.io/assessr/articles/example-ratio-study.html) package leverages this open data in its documentation.

## Releasing Open Data

Releasing open data entails building reproducible data, documenting it, determining how and how often it should be updated, and receiving clearance from all necessary parties. These steps are outlined in further detail below.

### Building Data

Open data should, whenever possible, be automatically updated (views or tables in Athena), well-maintained, or immutable (political boundaries). Datasets that are released to the public ***must be scripted and the script must be version-controlled***. To avoid creating discrepancies between internal and public use of the Department's data, data should not be built in a manner that is inconsistent with how it is used within the Department. Keep data as simple as possible - don't add columns that won't be useful for end-users and don't release redundant data.

### Adding Data to the Portal

The Data Department releases open data through the Cook County Open Data Portal, a service maintained by Socrata. For data that lives in the Department's warehouse, the preferred method for upload is through a provisioned Athena or S3 Socrata Gateway. When creating a new dataset there will be an opportunity to 'Connect to an External Data Source (Socrata Gateway)' where available data can be viewed. Make sure to add data to the portal using the Department's account (rather than a personal account) in order to properly establish ownership of the asset.

During the upload process set a schedule for updates (when applicable), add dataset metadata, and document, code/recode, and format columns. Recoding or 'transforming' columns entails writing SoQL blurbs while formatting columns is interactive within the 'Review & Configure Data' view. Choose a schedule that ensures the data is current but that doesn't needlessly pull data from AWS and run up monthly operating expenses - Socrata only offers daily to monthly update schedules, so if the data changes less frequently it should likely be updated manually (i.e. shapefiles). Adhere to the Department's asset naming convention by prefixing the asset with 'Assessor' and tag it with `property tax` and `cook county assessor`. Add documentation for the data to this wiki page.

It is highly recommended to create a 'Story' on Socrata or add to an existing one in order to describe and vignette the data for its intended audience.

Open data upload can also be automated using Socrata's SODA API and the [RSocrata package](https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata).

### Clearance

Clearance must be received from the following parties before private assets on the open data portal can be made public:

- Chief Data Officer
- Executive Committee, FOIA, Comms (optionally, TPI)
- Bureau of Technology

BoT may have their own clearance requirements such as adding a 'Story' on Socrata or formatting common county-related columns in a particular way. Defer to their schemas.

## Currently Curated Data

The Data Department creates and maintains the following open data sets.

### [Appeals](https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/Property-Taxation/Assessor-Appeals/y282-6ig3)

| Time Frame   | Property Classes | Unique By          | Row    | Updated |

| 1999-Present | 299, 399         | PIN, Year | Condominium Unit | Monthly |

**Notes:**

**Use cases:** This data describes the location and physical characteristics of all condominium units in the county. Condominium units are associated with substantially less characteristic data than single and multi-family improvements. It can be:

- Used on its own to characterize the housing stock in a specific location
- Joined to assessments for analysis of assessments across geographies and housing types
- Joined to sales for the construction of hedonic home value estimates

**Code:** [default.vw_pin_condo_char.sql](https://github.com/ccao-data/data-architecture/blob/master/dbt/models/default/default.vw_pin_condo_char.sql)

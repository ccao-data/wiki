# Wiki Content

This repository holds content displayed by the [Data Science Department Wiki](https://datascience.cookcountyassessor.com/wiki). The wiki is rendered using a [gollum backend](https://gitlab.com/ccao-data-science---modeling/documentation/wiki_content/-/tree/master) and is updated automatically every 3 minutes. You can also view the wiki content by going to [Home.md](Home.md) within GitLab.

The [Data Science Department Wiki](https://datascience.cookcountyassessor.com/wiki/) and GitLab should display nearly identical content. GitLab may not display rendered math equations correctly due to its strange formatting for inline equations.

To edit wiki content, simply use any markdown text editor and commit back to this repository. To edit individual pages, it's easiest to use GitLab's built-in markdown editor. Simply click `Edit` from within a markdown file to bring up a text editor and live markdown preview.

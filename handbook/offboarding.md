# Offboarding

> :warning: This page only applies to CCAO Data Science Department Interns and Capstone students who are leaving at the end of their quarter/semester.

If you're reading this, then it's finally time to say goodbye. :sob: We're sad to see you go, but hope you've gained something from being on the Data Science Team! After leaving, you'll automatically lose access to your CCAO email address, CCAO private GitLab repos, the VPN, and Teams. Here are the things you need to do before you leave:

# Checklist

- Change your GitLab account email under **Profile > Main settings**
- Return any CCAO equipment (if applicable)
- Email HR to confirm your last day and arrange your exit survey and interview
- Turn in your ID card to HR (at the same place you drop off your timesheet). If working remotely, mail your ID to the following address:
    ```
    ATTN: Human Resources
    Cook County Assessor's Office
    118 N. Clark St.
    Chicago, IL 60602
    ```
- Pick up your certificate from HR. If working remotely, provide a mailing address so they can send your certificate
- Delete any stored CCAO read-only database credentials (.Renviron or SQL_ACCESS.txt files) on your local machine
- Email the Chief Data Officer and Senior Data Scientists: 
  - A reminder to change the permissions on your GitLab account
  - A reminder to revoke any private API/deploy keys
  - Your contact information, in case we need to follow-up on something you worked on

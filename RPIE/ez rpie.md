# EZ-RPIE

The Cook County Assessor's Office is working to make filing your RPIE easier. During the next year, we will be creating APIs to allow third-party applications to file RPIE statements automatically. This will eliminate the cost of manually filing your RPIE, and allow you to easily keep records of your RPIE filings in your preferred application. 

**Private companies interested in participating in this program should contact us via RPIEsupport@cookcountyassessor.com.**

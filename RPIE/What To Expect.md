### Income and Expense

RPIE will collect income and expenses related to real property, not business operation. Different taxpayers account for such income in different ways.

* IRS Schedule E
* IRS Form 8825
* Income and expense statement
* Motel/Hotel income & expense 
* Lease document

Taxpayers who do not have IRS forms can submit income and expense information in three different ways

* Option 1: Report total expenses net of interest and deprectiation, and gorss.
* Option 2: Report gross rental income & subtotals for the following expenses for buildings you are filing for
        Maintenance
        Administration
        Utilities and sanitation services
        Finance and taxes
        Any other expenses you wish to volunteer
* Option 3: Report gross rental income & detailed expense information.

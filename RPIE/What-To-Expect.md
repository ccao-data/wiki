### Income and Expense

RPIE will request income and expenses (I&E) related to real property, not business operation. Different taxpayers account for such income in different ways. The RPIE system will determine which way you keep your I&E records, and should ask for the appropriate documents and.or information. These may include:

* IRS Schedule E
* IRS Form 8825
* Income and expense statement
* Motel/Hotel income & expense
* Lease document

Taxpayers who do not have IRS forms can submit income and expense information in three different ways:

* **Option 1:** Report total expenses net of interest and depreciation, and gross.
* **Option 2:** Report gross rental income & subtotals for the following expenses for buildings you are filing for:
** Maintenance
** Administration
** Utilities and sanitation services
** Finance and taxes
** Any other expenses you wish to volunteer
* **Option 3:** Report gross rental income & detailed expense information.

You can see an excel template for income and expense data [here](templates/rpie-ie-templates.xlsx).

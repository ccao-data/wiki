# Frequently Asked Questions about the Real Income & Expens Data Portal

## What is the Real Property Income and Expense Data Portal?

The Real Property Income and Expense Data Portal (RPIE, "R-pie") will help gather data critical to the accurate and fair assessment of commercial properties in Cook County. This Data Portal is the CCAO's first online filing system for industrial and commercial property owners in Cook County. Any data submitted for one single business property contributes to the fair and accurate property assessment not just of that property, but of similar businesses throughout the county. We are publishing a functional tool for voluntary data collection to provide an opportunity for taxpayers and their representatives to provide feedback about how the Office can improve this filing system. If you are unfamiliar with the Cook County Assessor's RPIE, please read the FAQs carefully.

***

#### Why do I need an RPIE code for every PIN number? 

**RPIE codes are for your protection.** These codes, which are mailed directly to taxpayers, are currently the only way to prevent unauthorized filings. Our office does not maintain a data set associating PINs with digital accounts, so anyone could theoretically file an infinite number of RPIE filings without some sort of authentication. RPIE codes prevent this from happening.

#### Is the RPIE mandatory for all properties?

**No.** The RPIE  is voluntary. The more businesses submit their information early in the year, the more accurate our assessments will be. You should encourage people to submit their RPIE form early because it will help us assess businesses in their community more accurately. Business can submit information throughout the year, but, again, earlier is better.

#### Does filing the RPIE Online initiate an appeal?

**No.** An appeal can be initiated only by filing the [CCAO'S online
appeal system.](https://www.cookcountyassessor.com/online-appeals)

#### Is the RPIE required to process an appeal?

**Yes.** A commercial appeal will not be processed if an RPIE was not filed with our office by the date appeals are due. Appeals calendar and deadlines can be found [here](https://www.cookcountyassessor.com/assessment-calendar-and-deadlines).

#### What property types are supported by the RPIE Online Form?

Any property that meets one of the following criteria:
* The property generates rental revenues.
* The property is occupied by a business, or is similar to properties occupied by a business, like a vacant retail space.
* The lessee of a property is responsible for taxes on the PIN.

#### Will I need to supply business income data?
**No.** The RPIE will only ask for rental income and expenses related to property management

#### The documents I am filing contain sensitive information, including my SSN. How is CCAO protecting my privacy?

**You private information is protected.** All sensitive identifying information is automatically redacted from your tax documents before any CCAO staff can see them. This includes SSN, name, address, and any other information that may be used to link a tax document to any property, company, or individual. RPIE data is stored in a secure server accessible only to a few authorized administrators. Data released to the public is aggregated such that individual incomes and expenses cannot be recovered. Sensitive information is not subject to FOIA. For more details, please read our [privacy statement](https://gitlab.com/ccao-data-science---modeling/documentation/wiki_content/-/blob/master/RPIE/CCAO-RPIE-Privacy-Policy.md).

#### What is the deadline for filing the RPIE Online Form?

Since filing an RPIE is voluntary, there is no deadline for filing. However, The Cook County Assessor requires an RPIE submission in order to process an appeal on a commercial or industrial property. Therefore, if you intend to appeal a particular PIN, you should submit your RPIE filing before the appeal deadline for that PIN. The Cook County Assessor will not consider late RPIE filings on appeal. The Cook County Assessor will not accept printed RPIE forms in lieu of an online submission.

#### What documents should I prepare to file

At minimum, you will need:

-   Each PIN & RPIE Code combination that was mailed to the
    owner of record.
-   Each Schedule E or Form 8825 associated with each PIN included in
    the filing, or an income and expense statement.

You may also want to have: 

* Your rent roll, formatted for the RPIE. You can download our commercial template here and our residential template here. 
* Information about the building's addresses. 
* The percentage of the building associated with each of your PINs.

For lessees responsible for taxes, please have:

-   Your lease requiring you to pay property taxes. 

#### lost my RPIE code! I need to edit a submitted filing! I need help (with the RPIE form)!

If you need support completing your RPIE submission, managing your account, or managing past submissions, please call our office at (312) 443-7550 or email us at [RPIEsupport@cookcountyassessor.com](mailto:RPIEsupport@cookcountyassessor.com)

#### Does the filing have to be completed by the property owner themselves?

**No.** This online tool is designed to support owners, lessees responsible for property taxes, and their representatives who are filing for one or mulitple business entities. You can even start a filing and then transfer the filing duties to another party.

#### How many RPIE filings should I submit?

There should be a 1-to-1 correspondence between your IRS Schedule E/Form8825, I & E statement, and/or net or triple net lease. For example, a large company that owns multiple apartment buildings should file a single RPIE filing that includes all the properties they own. If one individual owns multiple properties, and filed two IRS tax returns with two Schedule Es attached, they should submit two RPIE filings.

#### Will my data be saved to make future filings easier?

**Yes!** We have designed this form so that most of the data input in a given year will carry over to the next year for each PIN.

#### If I do not file an RPIE, what are the consequences?

There are no legal consequences for failing or refusing to file an RPIE. For those filing for the purpose of a property valuation appeal, per the Official Rules of the Cook County Assessor, not completing the RPIE form (using the PDF or online tool) is grounds for an appeal decision of "No Change." Property owners and their filing representatives who cannot use the RPIE Online Form can use the RPIE PDF forms.

#### How will the submitted data be used?

This data will be aggregated and anonymized, and combined with other data sets to produce internal diagnostic reports. These aggregated reports will provide The Assessor and his Dputies and Directors with information about the integrity of the assessment, the accuracy of assessments, appeals results, RPIE Onling Form participation rates, and other matters directly related to the valuation of income-producing properties, alongside other data sources used by the CCAO.   Data submitted during the beta testing phase will not be used for property valuation appeals. Data submitted after our beta testing phase that is associated with a PIN will also be used by analysts processing an appeal associated with that PIN.

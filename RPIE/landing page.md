RPIE is structured differently than other forms you may be familiar with. This data portal assembles and stores data in a structured database.  This helps our office use mass appraisal to estimate property values. Non-financial data you enter into this portal, including building and unit characteristics, will be stored and will pre-populate your filing next year. Over time, we hope this filing process because an easy annual task for all commercial taxpayers.

## Opportunity
The Data Science Department proposes to introduce Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to improve the Cook County Assessorâ€™s Office (CCAO) residential property appeals process for the purpose of providing comprehensive, clear, consistent rules for appeals. The implementation of SOPs for the 2021 reassessment will further align the appeals process with the CCAO three strategic values: fairness, transparency, and ethics.

## Background
In 2019, the Data Science Department developed a robust set of diagnostic tools to determine whether initial residential assessments were fair and accurate. When comparing appeal results for single-family appeals in 2019 and 2016, the data shows inconsistencies in appeal success rates. The linkage between the reason an appellant files a residential appeal, and the decision path an analyst uses to assign an appeal reason code are critical to our strategic values. Unfortunately, there is limited information available detailing what constitutes a successful appeal. 
For further details see [Comparing Residential Triennial Appeals in 2016 & 2019](https://gitlab.com/ccao-data-science---modeling/documentation/wiki_content/uploads/cf89ef12391221afbe4b1b6b8923c4af/Impact-of-Appeals-on-Vertical-Equity-in-a-Budget-Based-Property-Tax-Regime.html).

In 2020, the Data Science Department conducted a qualitative analysis on the transparency of rules to appeal. The public-facing websites of 10 counties in the United States was surveyed for well-defined rules on the residential appeals process and the criteria to win an appeal. When applying industry best practices themes, there were three consistent findings. First, none of the counties have a published single source of truth for the appeals process and win criteria. Second, six out of ten counties provided criteria on how to win an appeal, however there are inconsistencies due to the number of webpages and sources. Third, all counties provided varying degrees of information on reasons and rules to appeal, however the readability of this information does not perform well according to the basic standards of words per sentence, jargon, and length of text. Based on these observations, there is no industry standard for transparency of the appeals process. 
For further details see [Residential Appeals County Survey Data].

## Approach
SOPs create a rules-based approach to increase accuracy in predictability for analysts and appellants. This approach allows:

_Analysts to apply appeal decisions and reason codes that stand up to scrutiny. The expected outcome is increased precision in fairness and ethics through the application of market data formatted with rigorous rules that identify when to apply each reason code, including decision matrix guidance on amounts._

_Appellants to apply clear win criteria to anticipate the outcome of their appeal. The expected outcome is a transparent appeals process. This process will be initiated by holding a period of public comment for taxpayers to engage in SOPs prior to implementation, and result in a CCAO standard for rule-making and taxpayer engagement._

## Implementation
The SOPs should be applicable equally across properties.

The SOPs should be scalable to learning and inclusive of edge cases.

The SOPs should not create new opportunities for successful appeals or instability.

The SOPs should be available for public comment for a period of no less than 21 days and no more than 30 days.

## Adoption
If these SOPs are approved by the Cook County Assessor, the proposed SOPs will be put to the Valuations Department Residential Tax Analysts to process appeals in 2021. The impact of the SOPs will be analyzed at the end of the year to determine refinement.

# Hiring With GitLab

This article outlines the process of creating a job description, obtaining approval to hire, posting for a job, interviewing candidates, making a job offer, and onboarding a new hire. The CCAO is testing GitLab as a platform to facilitate this process.


### Job description

Make a job description

### Request to hire

The requesting deputy submits a request to hire issue ticket using the request to hire template. The Deputy Assessor Chief Operations Officer or their delegate authorizes the position's funding. The Director of Hunman Resources or their delegate authorizes the job description.

### Milestone

Once the request to hire is approved and the issue ticket is closed the Director of Human Resources @VWaller or his delegate creates a [project milestone](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/milestones/) titled 'Hire [Name of Position].' In the milestone description, indicate the number of people and the deparment for which the hiring is taking place. For example: 

> Title: **Hire Tranee Data Scientist**
>
> Description: Hire three Trainee Data Scientists for the Data Science Department.

The Director of Human Resources @VWaller or his delegate also creates the following issue tickets associated with this milestone:

* Recruitment
* Pre-interview selection
* Interview
* Selection
* Offer
* Pre-onboarding
* Onboarding
* Post-Onboarding

# Data Science Onboarding Process

The Data Science department has additional onboarding steps to be completed once a new employee has:

* An active VPN
* An active CCAO email
* Permission to install programs on their computer, if using CCAO hardware

In order to initiate this onboarding process, @VWaller should create an issue in the Employment repository using the ds-onboarding issue template, and assign the issue to the new hire.

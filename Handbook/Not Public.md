Material can be withheld from the public for the following reasons:

* The material contains sensitive, identifying information, including Social Security Numbers.
* The material pertains to sensitive employment actions, including discipline. 

## Residential exemptions

Residential exemptions identify individual people based on age, disability status, veterans status, and income. This is a lot of personal information. We have decided not to publish individual exemptions in order to protect the privacy of taxpayers.

## RPIE data

Some RPIE data individually identifies and reveals the income and profits of commercial properties. These fields have been withheld from public data due to privacy concerns. 

## Notes repository

The CCAO maintains a repository with notes from meetings. This is not made public since most of the notes are part of the deliberative process, and would be nearly useless to members of the public.

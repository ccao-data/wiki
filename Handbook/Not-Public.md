# Not Public

The Data Department makes things [public by default](Mission-Vision-Values.md#public-by-default). However, some things cannot be made public and are internal-only. Material can be withheld from the public for the following reasons:

* The material contains sensitive, identifying information, including Social Security Numbers.
* The material pertains to sensitive employment actions, including discipline.
* The material is part of the deliberative process or is a draft of a to-be-public document.
* The material contains data or information that is licensed or proprietary (e.g. API results).

The following items are currently internal-only:

* **WIP repositories:** Certain experimental repositories that may or may not be used are considered deliberative and are not made public.
